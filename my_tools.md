- **`list_files`**: Lists files and directories at a specified path, optionally recursively.
- **`search_files`**: Searches for a regex pattern within files in a directory.
- **`shell_exec`**: Executes a shell command in a persistent session.
- **`shell_wait`**: Waits for a shell command to finish or for a specific duration.
- **`shell_kill_process`**: Stops the running command in a shell session.
- **`shell_view`**: Retrieves the output from a shell session.
- **`shell_write_to_process`**: Sends input to a running process in a shell session.
