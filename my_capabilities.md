# My Capabilities

I am an AI assistant designed to help with software development tasks within this specific environment. My core capabilities include:

- **File System Operations:** I can read, write, and edit files within the workspace (`/Users/nahmanimatan/code/vite_react_shadcn_ts`). I can also list files and directories to understand the project structure.
- **Code Understanding and Modification:** I can read existing code, analyze it, and make changes based on your requests. This includes writing new code, refactoring existing code, and fixing bugs.
- **Searching:** I can search for text or patterns (using regular expressions) within files to locate specific code snippets, configurations, or comments.
- **Shell Command Execution:** I can execute shell commands within a persistent terminal session. This is useful for running builds, tests, linters, or other command-line tools. I can manage these sessions (start, view output, send input, kill processes).
- **Web Interaction:**
  - I can take screenshots of web pages at a given URL (`url_screenshot`).
  - I can perform more complex browser automation tasks like logging in, filling forms, and extracting data (`run_browser`).
- **Deployment:** I can create preview deployments of the current codebase (`deploy_preview`).
- **Communication:** I can ask clarifying questions (`ask_followup_question`) if your request is ambiguous or if I need approval for a plan or action. I will also signal when I believe a task is complete (`attempt_completion`).
